# 🌳 Decision Trees and Random Forests – Heart Disease Classification

This repository contains the solution for Task 5 of the AI & ML Internship program, where we explore tree-based classification techniques using the Heart Disease dataset.

## 📌 Objective

- Train and visualize a Decision Tree Classifier
- Analyze overfitting and prune the tree
- Train a Random Forest Classifier and compare results
- Interpret feature importance
- Evaluate model using cross-validation
